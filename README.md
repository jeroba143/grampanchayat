# Gram Panchayat Service (Vpet) 

 The Gram Panchayat Service Mobile Application is an innovative platform designed 
to improve communication and streamline service delivery for residents of a Gram Panchayat. 
This application serves as a bridge between the local government and the community, offering 
various modules that address essential needs, including accessing information about 
government projects, accepting complaints. By integrating technology into local governance, 
this project aims to empower rural communities, enhance transparency, and promote efficient 
service delivery.
